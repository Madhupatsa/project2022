**Analysis and Analytical Models for Hydraulic fracturing by using the Python.
It focusses on KGD and PKN Models **

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
Ø The length and width of the fracture increases rapidly when we inject fluid into the well with high pressure
Ø It may causes to expanding of fracture more and the HYDROCARBONS escapes from the reservoir to the
adjacent rocks

**PROPOSED SOLUTION**
Ø Fracture geometry (2D )
Ø Using python to plot(L vs T),(Wo vs T),(P vs T)
Ø Open Source

**Literature Review**

Fracture propagation
• Fracture width
• Modes of propagation
• Fracture propagation model • By using python scripts(libraries) TO PL0T 
• numpy (To perform mathematical operations on arrays)
• pandas ( used for data analysis and machine learning tasks) 
• matplotlib.pyplot (cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy)

**Objectives**

1. Study of the hydraulic fracture models.
2. To develop a 2D hydraulic fracture model.
3. To compare and analyze the KGD and PKN model results.
4. To study the influence of fracturing fluid parameters on the model

**2D-Models**

1. KGD model
2. PKN model

ØThese models are also known as constant height fracture models
ØReason – height is constant
Ø2d models are represented in varying length and width direction.

**To Determine**  
• 1. Fracture length
• 2. Opening width
• 3. Wellbore pressure

**NOMENCLATURE**
• L = Fracture Length (feet) 
• h = Fracutue Height (inch) 
• p = Fluid pressure Initial (psi) 
• Pw = Fluid Pressure at Well bore (psi) 
• Q = Flow Rate (bbl/min) 
• G = Shear Modulus (psi) 
• v = Poission’s ratio (dimension less) 
• μ = Viscosity (CP) 
• σ min =Min in-situ stress (psi)
• ∁l = Fluid Loss Co-efficient (K, cont)

**RESULTS**

PLOTS
• Fracture length vs. time
• Fracture width vs. time
• Pressure vs. time

**Conclusion**
• 2D hydraulic fracture modelling is useful to check for the trend in fracture length, fracture width and wellbore pressure with respect to time for a fixed height for different type of rock that are stimulated by hydraulic fracturing. 
• The trend will satisfy PKN and KGD model for propagation. 
• We can compare the trend of actual fracture and simulated fracture and check for the efficiency of the operation. 
• The treatment parameters and rock material properties plays a major role in designing of the fracturing.
